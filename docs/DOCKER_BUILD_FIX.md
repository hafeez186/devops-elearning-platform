# Docker Build Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `docker buildx failed with: ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c npm run build" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127`

**Root Cause**: Exit code 127 typically means "command not found". The issue was in the Docker build process where required dependencies were not available.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Server Dockerfile Issue
**Problem**: The server Dockerfile was trying to run `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation) but only had production dependencies installed (`--only=production`), so TypeScript was not available.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-stage build:
- **Build Stage**: Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies) and compile TypeScript
- **Production Stage**: Copy compiled code and install only production dependencies

### 2. Client Dockerfile Enhancement
**Problem**: The client build might fail if dev dependencies aren't explicitly included.

**Solution**: Used `npm ci --include=dev` to ensure all dependencies needed for the React build are available.

### 3. Health Check Implementation
**Added**: Created `server/healthcheck.js` file that the Dockerfile was referencing for container health checks.

## Files Modified

### Client (`client/Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
# Before: RUN npm ci
# After: RUN npm ci --include=dev
```

### Server (`server/Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
# Before: Single-stage build with production deps trying to run build
# After: Multi-stage build separating build and runtime environments
```

### Health Check (`server/healthcheck.js`)
```javascript
// New file: HTTP health check for container monitoring
```

## Technical Details

### Multi-Stage Docker Build Benefits
1. **Build Stage**: Has all tools needed (TypeScript, dev dependencies)
2. **Production Stage**: Lean runtime with only production dependencies
3. **Security**: Smaller final image surface area
4. **Performance**: Faster deployments and less storage

### Error Resolution
- Exit code 127 → Ensured all build tools are available
- TypeScript compilation → Separated build from runtime environment
- Health checks → Proper container monitoring

## Testing
Run the following to test the fix:
```bash
# Test client build
docker build -t test-frontend ./client

# Test server build  
docker build -t test-backend ./server
```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor CI/CD workflow execution
2. Verify successful Docker image creation
3. Test deployed containers functionality
4. Implement additional health check endpoints if needed

## Prevention
- Always separate build and runtime stages in Docker
- Explicitly specify dependency installation scope
- Include health checks for proper container monitoring
- Test Docker builds locally before pushing to CI/CD
