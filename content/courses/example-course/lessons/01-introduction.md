## ðŸ“– What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

### Key Benefits:
- **Consistency**: "It works on my machine" problem solved
- **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is supported
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to traditional VMs
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **DevOps Integration**: Perfect for CI/CD pipelines

## ðŸ”§ Core Concepts

### Images vs Containers
- **Image**: Read-only template used to create containers
- **Container**: Running instance of an image

### Docker Architecture

## ðŸ’» Interactive Exercise

Try these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Run your first container
docker run hello-world

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a
```
