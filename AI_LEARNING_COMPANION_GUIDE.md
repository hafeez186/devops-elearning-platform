#### **For a Progressing Learner:**
> "Great question about CI/CD pipelines! I can see you've been making solid progress recently. You've completed 3 topics recently - impressive progress! Let me help you dive deeper into this concept."

#### **Motivational Message:**
> "Amazing 12-day streak! You're becoming a DevOps expert! 🚀"

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Memory Management**

The companion uses an in-memory storage system for demo purposes (production would use a database):

```typescript
// Learning memory is stored per user
private learningMemories: Map<string, LearningMemory> = new Map();

// Session updates modify user's learning profile
updateLearningMemory(userId: string, session: LearningSession): void {
  // Updates weak areas, strengths, streak, learning time
  // Tracks frustrated topics and quick wins
  // Maintains learning history
}
```

### **Intelligence Algorithms**

1. **Struggle Detection**
   ```typescript
   private detectStruggle(memory: LearningMemory, currentTopic: string): boolean {
     const timeOnTopic = recentSessions
       .filter(session => session.topic === currentTopic)
       .reduce((total, session) => total + session.duration, 0);
     
     return timeOnTopic > 60 || memory.frustratedTopics.includes(currentTopic);
   }
   ```

2. **Topic Relationship Mapping**
   ```typescript
   private areTopicsRelated(topic1: string, topic2: string): boolean {
     const topicMap = {
       'docker': ['containerization', 'kubernetes', 'microservices'],
       'kubernetes': ['docker', 'orchestration', 'microservices'],
       'ci/cd': ['jenkins', 'github actions', 'deployment']
     };
     // Smart topic relationship detection
   }
   ```

3. **Emotional Tone Selection**
   ```typescript
   private determineEmotionalTone(memory: LearningMemory, isStruggling: boolean) {
     if (isStruggling) return 'empathetic';
     if (memory.currentStreak > 7) return 'motivational';
     if (memory.personalityPreference === 'encouraging') return 'encouraging';
     return 'neutral';
   }
   ```
